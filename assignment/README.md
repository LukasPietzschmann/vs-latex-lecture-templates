## Macros and Environments

- **task**: Creates a new task
  - `\task{<title>}` is kinda like `\section{<title>}` but with a different style.
  - There's also a starred version `\task*{<title>}` which doesn't set a task number and
    doesn't add it to the table of contents.
  - For non-mandatory tasks, use `\opttask{<title>}`. There's also a starred version
    `\opttask*{<title>}` similar to the starred version of `\task`.
- **subtasks**: Creates subtasks
  - The `subtasks` environment behaves like a numbered list. Using `\item`, you can
    create individual subtasks.
  - For non-mandatory subtasks, use `\optitem` to mark them as optional.
- **solution**: Creates a solution for the task
  - Content of the `solution` environment will only be set if the `solution` option is
    enabled. Otherwise, it will be ignored.
  - For shorter solutions that fit into a single line, you can use `\inlinesolution{<text>}`.
  - To do stuff when the `solution` option is set, you can use `\onsolution{<macros>}`.
- Miscellaneous
  - **link**: To typeset a link, you can use `\link <text> to <url>;`. Don't forget the
    semicolon at the end ;)
  - **underline**: While `\uline{<text>}` is fine, sometimes the underline has to be
    more pronounced. In that case, use `\ul`. It's usage is a bit more involved, so
    check out `config.tex` for a little tutorial. Maybe I' simplify it in the future.
  - This class also provides some tikz styles for common shapes, like `arrow`,
    `roundednode`, or `pill`. The full list is available in `config.tex`. When rolling
    your own styles, it might be a good idea to use `lw` and/or `rnd` for consistent
    line thickness and corner radii.
  - There are also macros for setting code. `\code[options]{<code}` will accept all
    options that `\lstinline` accepts. There's also `\codename{<name>}` for typesetting,
    e.g., class names and `filename{<name>}` for typesetting file names.
